                <p>I am a front-end web developer who holds an Bsc honors degree in Hydrology 
                and a Bsc degree in Geography and Hydrology from the University of Zululand. 
                I am currently learning to be a full stack web developer. If you are a 
                business seeking a web presence or an employer looking to hire, you are 
                in the right place. My approach to website design and development is to create 
                a website that strengthens your company’s brand while ensuring ease of use 
                and simplicity for your audience.

                <p>I want to go to Japan because I want to see their pristine natural scenery
                which includes Mt. Fuji, see some of the world’s most beautiful waterfalls and
                view the blooming of the pink cherry blossoms that bloom during winter. I also 
                want to experience the Japanese cuisine like kaiseki, the sushi conveyor belt and 
                sake bars. 
                </p>

                <p>I also want to see the beautiful temples and zen gardens like the Inari 
                Shrine is Fushimi Inari, which is dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice. Lastly 
                its because of people, society and culture Japan has. I want to go there to experience
                the anime side of the place because it is the birth place of worldwide famous anime titles
                like Dragonball Z, One Piece and Naruto to name a few</p>

                  <h1>Foreign Language I like to learn</h1>

                  <p>You may have guessed but yes it Japanese! The reason is I want to learn it so 
                    that when one day I get to travel there, I will able to understand the natives 
                  of Japan when they would be talking which ofcourse will make my immersion there more
                  exciting!! </p>
